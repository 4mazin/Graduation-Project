1158,Automation Business Analysis - Concepts and Principles,"Change is inevitable and so are the digital disruptions in every industry. What’s important from a business perspective is to align and adapt to such digital disruptions. In today’s competitive business market, the key to success is wise data-driven decisions, made based on reliable information. As part of your work responsibilities, you would have discovered, synthesized, and analyzed information collected from various sources at some point in time. This is Business Analysis. It is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to enterprise business problems. Like we said earlier, a plethora of digital disruptions are taking place in every industry. We are witnessing the growth of a digital-ready culture with automation at its helm. Automation generates productivity boosts at the process, workflow, and workforce levels, thereby shaping organizational growth and longevity. With organizations moving towards automation, it’s of paramount importance for a Business Analyst to be skilled with the science of automation to facilitate communication and collaboration with relevant stakeholders. As a strong proponent of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), UiPath brings in the Automation Business Analyst role, who will be responsible for analyzing business requirements, identifying possible automatable processes as well as potential pitfalls, along with assessing the impact of automation implementation. Through this course, you will learn techniques for ensuring project success at every step-from understanding the enterprise problems or goals, to designing solutions, devising strategies, and thereby, driving change.  Along with the foundational business analysis skills, you will also learn how to incorporate business analysis deliverables and models into an RPA specific Process Definition Document (PDD), which is the representation of ‘as-is’ business processes that are chosen for automation. Throughout this course the terms ‘Robotic Process Automation’ (RPA) and ‘Automation’ have been used interchangeably. Aligned with IIBA's BABOK, this course will help you take the first step in your Business Analyst journey and will aid you with preparation for ECBA (Entry Certificate in Business Analysis).To complete this course, you will need IIBA’s BABOK Guide, which can be accessed at no additional cost.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/automation-business-analyst,change inevitable digital disruption industry important business perspective align adapt digital disruption today competitive business market key success wise data drive decision base reliable information work responsibility discover synthesize analyze information collect source point time business analysis set task knowledge technique require identify business need determine solution enterprise business problem like early plethora digital disruption place industry witness growth digital ready culture automation helm automation generate productivity boost process workflow workforce level shape organizational growth longevity organization automation paramount importance business analyst skilled science automation facilitate communication collaboration relevant stakeholder strong proponent robotic process automation rpa uipath bring automation business analyst role responsible analyze business requirement identify possible automatable process potential pitfall assess impact automation implementation course learn technique ensure project success step understand enterprise problem goal design solution devise strategy drive change foundational business analysis skill learn incorporate business analysis deliverable model rpa specific process definition document pdd representation business process choose automation course term robotic process automation rpa automation use interchangeably align iiba babok course help step business analyst journey aid preparation ecba entry certificate business complete course need iiba babok guide access additional cost

Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?",https://www.coursera.org/learn/einstein-relativity,course seek understand einstein especially focus special theory relativity albert einstein year old patent clerk introduce miracle year goal myth making popularized presentation relativity order gain deep understanding einstein person concept prediction strange paradox theory question address include einstein come idea nature genius meaning relativity special special theory relativity theory initially dead arrival mean time fourth dimension time actually run slowly person size thing change depend velocity time travel possible thing travel fast speed light possible travel center galaxy return lifetime evidence definitively confirm theory mainly speculation einstein win nobel prize theory relativity

1297,"Leading for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education","This course is open to professionals interested in learning more about leadership in higher education for a changing demographic or interested in developing their own leadership skills. The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics. Reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted. To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming—if done well—can be transformative for organizers and participants.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/leading-for-equity-diversity-inclusion,course open professional interested learn leadership high education change demographic interested develop leadership skill idea individual teach lead skeptic reasonable people scholar field point important trait skill attribute observe visible leader contend certain quality necessary effective leadership easily transmit accept premise conclude people bear natural leader expect lead mistake end logical spectrum believe leadership teach long concurrently nurture people possess constellation strength construct leadership philosophy approach leadership development programming transformative organizer participant

The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research?specialization=data-science-foundations-r,course focus concept tool report modern datum analysis reproducible manner reproducible research idea datum analysis generally scientific claim publish datum software code verify finding build need reproducibility increase dramatically datum analysis complex involve large dataset sophisticated computation reproducibility allow people focus actual content data analysis superficial detail report write summary addition reproducibility analysis useful datum code actually conduct analysis available course focus literate statistical analysis tool allow publish datum analysis single document allow easily execute analysis obtain result

2983,"Dense Gases, Liquids and Solids","Course 4 of Statistical Thermodynamics addresses dense gases, liquids, and solids. As the density of a gas is increased, intermolecular forces begin to affect behavior. For small departures from ideal gas behavior, known as the dense gas limit, one can estimate the change in properties using the concept of a configuration integral, a modification to the partition function. This leads to the development of equations of state that are expansions in density from the ideal gas limit. Inter molecular potential energy functions are introduced and it is explored how they impact P-V-T behavior. As the density is increased, there is a transition to the liquid state. We explore whether this transition is smooth or abrupt by examining the stability of a thermodynamic system to small perturbations. We then present a brief discussion regarding the determination of the thermodynamic properties of liquids using concept of the radial distribution function (RDF), and how the function relates to thermodynamic properties. Finally, we explore two simple models of crystalline solids.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/dense-gases-liquids-solids?specialization=statistical-thermodynamics-engineering,course statistical thermodynamics address dense gas liquid solid density gas increase intermolecular force begin affect behavior small departure ideal gas behavior know dense gas limit estimate change property use concept configuration integral modification partition function lead development equation state expansion density ideal gas limit inter molecular potential energy function introduce explore impact p v t behavior density increase transition liquid state explore transition smooth abrupt examine stability thermodynamic system small perturbation present brief discussion regard determination thermodynamic property liquid use concept radial distribution function rdf function relate thermodynamic property finally explore simple model crystalline solid

3387,Social Network Analysis,"This course is designed to quite literally ‘make a science’ out of something at the heart of society: social networks. Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-network-analysis?specialization=computational-social-science-ucdavis,course design literally science heart society social network human natural network scientist compute new network configuration time unaware think friend family particular form social network colleague organizational relation overlap network structure navigate delicate opportunistic network configuration save guard advance social standing society big social network network structure exist computational social science help reveal study systematically course focus network structure look static snapshot network intricate reveal important aspect social system hand lab visualize analyze network software help appreciate complexity social network second course look network evolve time ask predict kind network form influence network dynamic

It is recommended that you take the first course, DeFi Infrastructure, before this course. In this course, we talk about transaction mechanics and introduce both fungible and non-fungible tokens – or NFTs. The course explores the important issue of custody (holding private keys). The course then explores supply adjustment which includes the minting and burning of tokens. The mechanics of bonding curves are introduced. The course then explores the role of direct as well as indirect  incentives in the DeFi system.  We then analyze swaps or decentralized exchange. We begin by contrasting DEX with centralized exchange (e.g., Coinbase or Binance). The course details the mechanics of Automated Market Makers and provides a number of detailed examples. There is a discussion of impermanent loss as well as (legal) front-running.
